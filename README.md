# ClipboardGPT

It monitors clipboard for text changes and queries to chatGPT.

Any text copied with first line starting with // will act like a trigger.

Currently it uses python library https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT to query to ChatGPT.
Kindly follow https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT/wiki/Setup to install python related dependancies.

TODO:
1. Embed portable python with required dependancies.
2. Create setup package
